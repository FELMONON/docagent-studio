Welcome to the Notion export example for DocAgent.

## What This Is

This folder simulates a Notion Markdown export. In a real export you will have nested folders, attachments, and pages.

## Key Idea

DocAgent treats markdown under a `--notion-root` as `notion:` sources so citations preserve the origin.
